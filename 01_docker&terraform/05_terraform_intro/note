Terraform definition: 
  Terraform is a tool that automates infrastructure management using code. 
  It helps you define, create, and update cloud resources like servers, databases, and storage automatically.

1. go to gcp and create a service acount
2. using terraform to connect

This Terraform code is used to configure and manage resources on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Here's a detailed explanation of its purpose and functionality:

### **Code Explanation**

#### **1. `terraform` Block**
```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    google = {
      source  = "hashicorp/google"
      version = "6.27.0"
    }
  }
}
```
- **Purpose**: Specifies the required providers and their versions for this Terraform configuration.
- **Key Components**:
  - **`required_providers`**:
    - Defines the provider(s) that Terraform will use. In this case, it specifies the `google` provider for managing GCP resources.
    - **`source`**: Indicates the source of the provider, which is `hashicorp/google` (the official Google Cloud provider maintained by HashiCorp).
    - **`version`**: Specifies the version of the provider to use (`6.27.0` in this case). This ensures compatibility and avoids unexpected changes from newer versions.

---

#### **2. `provider` Block**
```terraform
provider "google" {
  project = "seventh-league-447908-t0"
  region  = "us-central1"
}
```
- **Purpose**: Configures the `google` provider with specific settings for your GCP project.
- **Key Components**:
  - **`project`**: Specifies the GCP project ID (`seventh-league-447908-t0`) where Terraform will create and manage resources.
  - **`region`**: Defines the default region (`us-central1`) for resources created by this provider. This ensures that resources are deployed in the specified geographic location.

---

### **Overall Purpose**
- This code sets up Terraform to manage resources on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using the `google` provider.
- It ensures that Terraform uses the correct provider version and connects to the specified GCP project and region.

---

### **Next Steps**
After this configuration, you can define additional Terraform resources (e.g., virtual machines, storage buckets, databases) in the same file or other `.tf` files. Terraform will use the `google` provider to create and manage these resources in the specified project and region.

For example:
```terraform
resource "google_storage_bucket" "example" {
  name     = "example-bucket"
  location = "us-central1"
}
```

This would create a storage bucket in the `us-central1` region of the specified GCP project.

What is BigQuery and What is a Dataset?
📌 What is BigQuery?
BigQuery is a fully managed, serverless data warehouse provided by Google Cloud, designed for storing, querying, and analyzing large-scale data (terabytes or petabytes).

Key Features:
✅ Massive-scale querying (optimized for TB/PB-level data)
✅ SQL support (query data using SQL)
✅ Serverless architecture (no infrastructure management)
✅ Automatic scaling (computing resources are allocated dynamically)
✅ Real-time data analysis (supports streaming data ingestion and queries)

📌 What is a Dataset in BigQuery?
A Dataset in BigQuery is a logical grouping used to store tables. You can think of a Dataset as a Schema (or Namespace) in a traditional database.

🎯 BigQuery Data Structure
📂 Project (e.g., my_project)
┣ 📁 Dataset (e.g., sales_data)
┃ ┣ 📄 Table (e.g., orders)
┃ ┗ 📊 View (virtual table based on queries)
