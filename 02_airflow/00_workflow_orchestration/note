1. 1️⃣ What is a Data Pipeline? 🚰
A Data Pipeline is a series of steps to move, transform, and process data from one system to another. It automates data movement between sources (databases, APIs, files) and destinations (data warehouses, data lakes).
📌 Key Components of a Data Pipeline:
🔹 Data Ingestion → Extract data from multiple sources
🔹 Data Transformation → Clean, filter, and aggregate data
🔹 Data Loading → Store the processed data in a target system
🔹 Monitoring & Error Handling → Ensure reliability and correctness
🛠 Examples of Data Pipeline Tools:
Batch Processing: Apache Spark, AWS Glue, Google Dataflow
Stream Processing: Apache Kafka, Apache Flink

2. 2️⃣ What is Workflow Orchestration? 🎛️
Workflow Orchestration is the process of managing and scheduling multiple interdependent tasks within a data pipeline. It ensures that tasks run in the correct order, with the right dependencies, and at the right time.

3. 📌 Key Responsibilities of Workflow Orchestration:
✅ Task Scheduling → Runs tasks at specific times or based on triggers
✅ Dependency Management → Ensures tasks execute in the correct sequence
✅ Monitoring & Alerts → Tracks execution, logs errors, and retries failed jobs
✅ Resource Optimization → Allocates computing power efficiently
🛠 Examples of Workflow Orchestration Tools:

4. DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) in Data Engineering
A DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) is a key concept in workflow orchestration, especially in tools like Apache Airflow. It represents a series of tasks that must be executed in a specific order, ensuring that no cycles (infinite loops) exist.

5. 🔹 What is a DAG?
✅ Directed → Tasks have a clear sequence (A → B → C)
✅ Acyclic → No task loops back to an earlier task (No A → B → A)
✅ Graph → A structure of nodes (tasks) and edges (dependencies)

6. 🚀 Why Use DAGs in Workflow Orchestration?
✅ Manages Dependencies → Ensures tasks run in the right order
✅ Prevents Infinite Loops → No cycles mean no infinite execution
✅ Enables Parallel Execution → Some tasks can run at the same time
✅ Easily Scalable → Modify and extend workflows dynamically
