1. üîπ What is Apache Airflow?
Apache Airflow is an open-source workflow orchestration tool that helps automate, schedule, and monitor data pipelines. It is widely used in ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), Machine Learning, and Cloud Workflows.

2. üõ†Ô∏è How Apache Airflow Works?
1Ô∏è‚É£ DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) ‚Üí A workflow structure that defines tasks & dependencies
2Ô∏è‚É£ Tasks (Operators) ‚Üí Each step in the workflow (e.g., extract, transform, load)
3Ô∏è‚É£ Scheduler ‚Üí Decides when and how tasks should run
4Ô∏è‚É£ Executor ‚Üí Runs tasks (local, Celery, Kubernetes, etc.)
5Ô∏è‚É£ Web UI ‚Üí Monitors workflow execution and logs

3. üîπ 1. Scheduler
The core component that parses DAGs, determines task dependencies, and assigns executable tasks to the Executor.
Responsibilities:
Periodically scan DAG files
Schedule and trigger tasks based on dependencies
Send runnable tasks to the Executor
Task Trigger Methods:
Time-based scheduling (using cron expressions)
Event-driven triggers
Dependencies on other DAG tasks

4. üîπ Apache Airflow Architecture

Apache Airflow's architecture is designed to manage and orchestrate workflows efficiently. Below are the key components:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)**:
   - Define workflows as a series of tasks with dependencies.
   - Written in Python, allowing dynamic and flexible workflows.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Scheduler**:
   - Periodically scans DAG files to identify tasks that need to run.
   - Determines task dependencies and schedules tasks accordingly.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Executor**:
   - Executes tasks in the workflow.
   - Types of Executors:
     - **SequentialExecutor**: Runs tasks sequentially (for testing or small-scale use).
     - **LocalExecutor**: Runs tasks in parallel on the same machine.
     - **CeleryExecutor**: Distributes tasks across multiple workers (for large-scale workflows).
     - **KubernetesExecutor**: Runs tasks in Kubernetes pods for scalability and isolation.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Metadata Database**:
   - Stores the state of DAGs, tasks, and their execution history.
   - Commonly uses databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Web Server (Web UI)**:
   - Provides a user interface to monitor, manage, and debug workflows.
   - Displays DAGs, task statuses, logs, and execution history.

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Workers**:
   - Execute tasks assigned by the Executor.
   - In distributed setups (e.g., CeleryExecutor), workers run on separate machines.

7Ô∏è‚É£ **Triggerer**:
   - Handles event-based triggers for tasks that depend on external events.

8Ô∏è‚É£ **Logs**:
   - Stores logs for each task execution, which can be accessed via the Web UI.

### **How the Components Work Together**
1. **DAGs** are defined in Python and stored in the DAG folder.
2. The **Scheduler** scans the DAGs, determines dependencies, and schedules tasks.
3. The **Executor** assigns tasks to **Workers** for execution.
4. The **Metadata Database** tracks the state of tasks and workflows.
5. The **Web Server** provides a UI for monitoring and managing workflows.
6. Logs are generated for each task and stored for debugging and auditing.

This architecture allows Apache Airflow to scale from small, single-machine setups to large, distributed systems, making it a powerful tool for orchestrating complex workflows.
